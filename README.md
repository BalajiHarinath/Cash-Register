# Cash-Register
A Cash Register app created using vanillaJs which helps the shopkeeper to calculate the amount to be returned to the customer after billing with minimum number of notes.
 
The app takes the bill amount and the cash paid as inputs.

If the bill amount is negative it displays a message to enter a valid bill amount and also if the cash given is less than the bill amount it displays a message saying that the cash given should be greater than the bill amount.

If all the inputs are valid it outputs a table displaying the denomination of the notes.
